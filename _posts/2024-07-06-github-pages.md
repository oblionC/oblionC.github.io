title: "Using github pages for creating a blog page that looks great, quickly!"

This is my first ever post on my blog page, and to celebrate, I am going to be talking about how I learnt to use Github Pages and Jekyll to create this page.

GitHub pages is a free service provided by Github to allow individuals and small businesses to host relatively small, static websites. These websites are most suitable for containing blogs or information about a small organization's products and services. Overall, its a really easy and convenient way to kick things off, which is the reason why I chose it over creating a website from scratch, atleast for now.

Heres the link to the Github Skills repository that I followed to learn about Github Pages: https://github.com/skills/github-pages
Its a really cool tutorial where GitHub actions changes the README.md file after you complete each step. It really made me curious about Github actions, and I think that will be what I'll be learning next. 

It's unfortunate that only *minima* has default support for posts, however I am planning on customizing one of the supported themes to show posts as well. 

I will be recording close to everything I learn from now on, so keep an eye out :).
